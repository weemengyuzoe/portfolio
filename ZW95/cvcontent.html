            <h3>About me ⚦</h3>
            <p>
                I am a passionate designer that believes that there will always be something out there to learn and
                be inspired by, keeping an open mind towards new opportunities that I come across. Consequently,
                this led to having experience designing using different mediums and software alongside working with
                clients of diverse backgrounds.
                <br>
                <br>
                It always brings me immense joy and satisfaction whenever I complete a project or get to help clients
                convey their objectives
                with my work or anyone in need.

                    <br>
                    Working as a barista in a fast-paced café environment has strengthened my attention to detail, time
                    management, communication skills as well as hands-on coordination. From crafting visually appealing
                    drink presentations to engaging with diverse customers, this role has helped me develop strong
                    adaptability, and problem-solving under pressure — key traits that I apply to my projects.

                    My job is to manage and teach multiple groups
                    of students of varying ages. They can range from kindergarten kids to working adults and even
                    the elderly, although the most common age would
                    be 4-9y/o. While being proficient, I also need to ensure the safety of the students and use
                    different teaching styles for each individual.

                    I worked as an assistant to promote electronics and gadgets such as power banks, cables, and

                    credit card system works.
